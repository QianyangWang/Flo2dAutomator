# Flo2dAutomator

## Introduction

This is a demo program for executing a Flo2d simulation project without the original software's GUI. It can automatically close the pop-up simulation summary/volume conservation summary window when using the original GUI. The source code can be used as a part of the real-time flood simulation & management system. Also, it can be used to develop a Flo2d calibration tool.

It was written using VB6.0, while the python script version has also been provided in this repository.

## Usage

1. Import the Flo2d simulation project folder in the first line.

2. Import the path of the Flo2d executable in the second line.
3. Click the "Run" button.
